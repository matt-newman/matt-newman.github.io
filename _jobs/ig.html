    <div class="project col span-6">
        <h4 class="title">Building <a href="http://IG.com">IG.com</a></h4>
        <p>Consolidating IG’s multiple websites (12 – one per country) down to just <a href="http://ig.com">ig.com</a>.
            This involved moving from a custom internal CMS to Adobe’s CQ CMS (now AEM). It posed a number of design and
            SEO challenges that had to be solved as well.</p>

    <div class="project col span-6">
        <h4 class="title">Improving the deployment process:</h4>
        <p>The objective was to move from a 4 week release cycle down to 2 weeks, which involved introducing unit tests
            and functional testing as well as a script to run for the deploy process itself. I introduced and trained
            the team in writing and using unit and functional tests.</p>

    <div class="project col span-6">
        <h4 class="title">Making <a href="http://www.ig.com/">IG.com</a> responsive:</h4>
        <p>In order to comply with Google’s ‘mobile-friendly’ directives we established a number of best practices for
            the content teams to follow and tweaked components to make them work across as many devices as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project col span-6">
        <h4 class="title">Stronger Encryption:</h4>
        <p>In order to address a potential https exploit on an Akamai Edge server we worked with several teams to
            implement a version of the password reset functionality adding a layer of encryption to the
            password being submitted. This work was also designed to follow the principals of graceful degradation.</p>
