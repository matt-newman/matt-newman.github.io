<div class="job-description">
    <p>Starting as a UI developer, I worked on a custom built CMS to support European Directories. I worked on several
        projects whilst at First Clarity and had a lot of client interaction and client facing work. Primarily working
        with HTML, CSS, Javascript. I gained and expertise in SVN and also started working more on the command line and
        also with Java, Maven, Jenkins and started experimenting with unit and functional testing of the front-end.</p>
    <p>I also did some wire-framing, documentation for both clients and internal use. I also did performance testing
        (front-end).</p>
    <p>I became a team lead and with one of the other Senior UIs and together we led a team of up to 20 front-end
        developers and ran lunchtime sessions to help others learn some of the fundamental principals that would allow
        them to solve any problem in the best way possible.</p>
