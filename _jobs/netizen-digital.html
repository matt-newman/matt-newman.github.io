<div class="overview">
    <p>Starting as a junior working mainly on support I quickly became a part of the delivery team and gained exposure to the entire project life cycle. In early 2008 I was tasked with creating guidelines for the best practices for site ‘cut-up’ as I was then one of the primary people within the company for front-end development. Whilst at Netizen I gained many invaluable skills and frequently sort to learn from the highly experienced senior developers.</p>
