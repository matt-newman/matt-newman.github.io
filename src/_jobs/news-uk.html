<div class="overview">
    <p>I worked as part of the Commercial Engineering team, we overhauled/replaced the existing Admanager integration,
        achieving a 3-fold increase in ad-revenue on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Whilst there I also helped the core Sun and Times teams do some performance optimization improvements.</p>
    <p>I setup the pipeline build for the Commercial Engineering team, using CircleCI (with npm/bash commands) to bring
        it in line with the wider NewsUK platform usage.</p>

        <h4 class="title">Replace existing Admanager/Prebid integration</h4>
        <p>This forms the mechanism by which The Sun (and later all NewsUK sites), have their ads delivered/displayed,
            so is absolutely cruical as it forms a major part of their revenue strategy.</p>

        <h4 class="title">Deployment pipeline</h4>
        <p>As we worked on a new system, it made sense to replace the existing (difficult and multi-step) process with
            one that was easy, reliable and consistent.</p>

    <div class="project col span-6">
        <h4 class="title">Sun & Times Performance improvements</h4>
        <p>Due to personal interest as well as experience in this domain, I was able to help the core web teams review,
            plan and enact a number of improvements.</p>
