                <p>Semantic coding to W3C standards, I have an appreciation for using the best possible base in terms of markup as it makes everything else flow more smoothly. To me this means trying to follow best practices such as graceful degradation or progressive enhancement whilst building as much as possible using what is available via native APIs.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>I've got an ideal of writing and maintaining clean and efficient CSS. A constant desire to keep up with the ever evolving landscape of CSS as browser standards and adoption evolve, through an evolution from using tables for layout, inline styles and attributes in an email context, to using floats for layout in external stylesheets, shifting towards using flexbox for layout with varying prefix based support. With this I've seen and used a number of different strategies for authoring CSS, such as a modular pattern for self contained components, to OOCSS and strategies for addressing different problems such as background and font colour inheritance for links etc.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Solid understanding of code and ways to try and keep code clean and testable. Decent understanding of various design patterns. Lately where possible I’d try and opt for micro-libraries and browser native support for a lot of interaction with the DOM. I’ve obviously used jQuery, written a couple of custom node scripts, written a number of unit tests for key functionality mostly using Jasmine. Written and maintained CasperJS functional tests.</p>

                <p>A good grasp how to use the command line for a variety of tasks, with a familiarity with a few of the vast number of incredibly useful tools available. Obviously more recently using the command line for grunt and task runners to aid automated build tasks and testing.</p>

            <p>I’m passionate about web development with a real desire to do the best job that I can and produce something that I can be proud of. I like to work towards having an optimal process in place so a given team or individual can more easily do the best work possible, to me lately this means that I like to work on or towards having things like automated deployment and and well scoped pieces of work so that any effort is directed towards solving the right thing!</p>
            <p>Throughout my career as a developer I have strived to further my understanding of programs, software and the development process in general by reading material on the concepts and principals of programming (see below), I’ve also spent time studying and discussing best practice for web page design, structure, function and implementation.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include a variety of sports, particularly football, which I spend a lot of free time doing, as I play for a few different teams. I’m also really enthusiastic about snowboarding even if I’m not that good. I used to spend some of my time playing some chess, solving logic puzzles and doing crosswords but I find less time for those things now.</p>
