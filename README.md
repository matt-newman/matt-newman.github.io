## Skills Summary

### (X)HTML (8+ years): 
Excellent standard with semantic coding to W3C standards, I have a true appreciation for using the the best possible base in terms of markup as it makes everything else flow more smoothly. To me this often means trying to follow best practice such as graceful degradation or progressive enhancement.

### CSS (8+ years): Excellent knowledge of cross-browser workings, with a determination to have clean and efficient CSS, a constant willingness to try and keep up with the ever evolving landscape of CSS.

### Javascript (5+ years): Solid understanding of code and the best ways to try and keep code clean. Lately where possible I'd try and opt for micro-libraries and browser native support for a lot of interaction with the DOM. I've obviously used JQuery, written a couple of custom node scripts, written a number of unit tests for key functionality, using Jasmine. Written and maintained CasperJS functional tests.

### Command Line (3+ years): A good grasp how to use the command line for a variety of tasks, with a familiarity with a few of the vast number of incredibly useful tools available.

### Apache, MySQL, PHP Stack (3+ years): Intermediate level PHP with an understanding of PHP5 and therefore some of the OO functions, constructs and techniques that are available. Intermediate level SQL with a good understanding of relational database design and n-tier normalisation. A good grasp of the principals of using and administering Apache (in Mac, Linux and Windows).

### XML and XSLT (2 years experience): High standard, comfortable performing a variety of different tasks in xslt together with a firm grasp of native functions available and also a lot of the extended functionality that can be provided by exslt.
Other: Both a Windows & Mac user. As mentioned above, comfortable using the command line. Used SVN and keen to learn GIT.

## Previous Employment

### December 2011 – June 2015: IG
Whilst at IG I worked on a few large projects:

#### Building IG.com
Consolidating IG's multiple websites (12 – one per country) down to just ig.com. This involved moving from a custom internal CMS to Adobe's CQ CMS (now AEM). It posed a number of design and SEO challenges that had to be solved as well.
##### Technologies used:
* CQ
* Java
* Maven
* Bamboo
* JSP
* Apache
* CDN (Akamai)
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

#### Improving the deployment process:
The objective was to move from a 4 week release cycle down to 2 weeks, which involved introducing unit tests and functional testing as well as a script to run for the deploy process itself. I introduced and trained the team in writing and using unit and functional tests.
##### Technologies used:
* Javascript
* Jasmine
* CasperJS
* Karma
* Maven
* Bamboo
* Python

#### Making IG.com responsive:
In order to comply with Google's 'mobile-friendly' directives we established a number of best practices for the content teams to follow and tweaked components to make them work across as many devices as possible.
##### Technologies used:
* CQ (and associated stack above)
* Node (some content replacement scripts).

#### Stronger Encryption:
In order to address a potential https exploit on an Akamai Edge server we had to work with several teams to implement a version of the password reset functionality that added another layer of encryption to the password being submitted. This work was also designed to follow the principals of graceful degradation and progressive enhancement.
##### Technologies used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Jasmine
* CasperJS

### June 2010 – December 2011: First*Clarity
Starting as a UI developer, I worked on a custom built CMS to support European Directories. I worked on several projects whilst at First Clarity and had a lot of client interaction and client facing work. Primarily working with HTML, CSS, Javascript. I gained and expertise in SVN and also started working more on the command line and also with Java, Maven, Jenkins and started experimenting with unit and functional testing of the front-end.

I also did some wire-framing, documentation for both clients and internal use. I also did performance testing (front-end).

I became a team lead and with one of the other Senior UIs and together we led a team of up to 20 front-end developers and ran lunchtime sessions to help others learn some of the fundamental principals that would allow them to solve any problem in the best way possible.

### November 2008 – May 2010: Collective Colour
Brought in to extend the service offerings provided by Collective. I took the lead on a variety of technical endeavours that were already undertaken by Collective, such as: a Web-to-Print Management System and Photobook-Software (built by a 3rd party which Collective created and administered products).

As the only developer there I was responsible for the setup of my working environment and the estimation of all quotes on any tenders or bids involving development work. I was also responsible for all interaction with clients regarding the development of their site including doing things like needs analysis and requirements scoping.

#### Sites built whilst at Collective include:

In early 2008 I was tasked with creating guidelines for the best practices for site ‘cut-up’ as I was then one of the primary people within the company for front-end development. Whilst at Netizen I gained many invaluable skills and frequently sort to learn from the highly experienced senior developers.

## General Information

I'm passionate about web development with a real desire to do the best job that I can and produce something that I can be proud of. I like to work towards having an optimal process in place so a given team or individual can more easily do the best work possible, to me lately this means that I like to work on or towards having things like automated deployment and and well scoped pieces of work so that any effort is directed towards solving the right thing!

Throughout my career as a developer I have strived to further my understanding of programs, software and the development process in general by reading material on the concepts and principals of programming (see below), I’ve also spent time studying and discussing best practice for web page design, structure, function and implementation. 

My hobbies include a variety of sports, particularly football (which before I sustained an ankle injury I played 2-3 times a week during the season), snowboarding – which I've really enthusiastic about even if I'm not that good. I also occasionally enjoy badminton, swimming and running. I used to enjoy playing some chess, solving logic puzzles and doing crosswords but I find less time for those things now.
