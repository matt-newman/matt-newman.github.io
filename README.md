## About me

I’m passionate about web development with a real desire to produce the best outcome possible for both end users and the business I represent. I like to work towards having an optimal process in place so a given team or individual can more easily produce the best work possible, to me lately this means that I like to work on or towards having things like automated deployment and and well scoped pieces of work so that any effort is directed towards solving the right thing!

Throughout my career as a developer I have strived to further my understanding of programs, software and the development process in general by reading material on the concepts and principals of programming (see below), I've also spent time studying and discussing best practice for performance, design, structure, function, implementation and testing of websites and pages. I'm particularly keen on trying to make sure the end-user performance of pages is as good as it reasonably can be (fast performance is a never ending goal).

My hobbies include a variety of sports, particularly football, which I spend a lot of free time doing; I really enjoy snowboarding, regardless of my skill level. I used to spend some of my time playing some chess, solving logic puzzles and doing crosswords but I find less time for those things now.

## Skills Summary

### HTML 
used since 2007

Semantic coding to W3C standards, I have an appreciation for using the best possible base in terms of markup as it makes everything else flow more smoothly. To me this means trying to follow best practices such as graceful degradation or progressive enhancement whilst building as much as possible using what is available via native APIs.

### CSS 
used since 2007

* LESS used since 2012
* SASS used since 2011

I've got an ideal of writing and maintaining clean and efficient CSS. A constant desire to keep up with the ever evolving landscape of CSS as browser standards and adoption evolve, through an evolution from using tables for layout, inline styles and attributes in an email context, to using floats for layout in external stylesheets, shifting towards using flexbox for layout with varying prefix based support. With this I've seen and used a number of different strategies for authoring CSS, such as a modular pattern for self contained components, to OOCSS and strategies for addressing different problems such as background and font color inheritance for links etc.

### Javascript 
used since 2010

* jQuery used since 2010
* Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, Karma used since 2013
* Mustache used since 2014
* CasperJS used since 2013
* NodeJS, NPM used since 2014
* Grunt used since 2014

Solid understanding of code and ways to try and keep code clean and testable. Decent understanding of various design patterns. Lately where possible I’d try and opt for micro-libraries and browser native support for a lot of interaction with the DOM. I’ve obviously used jQuery, written a couple of custom node scripts, written a number of unit tests for key functionality mostly using Jasmine. Written and maintained CasperJS functional tests.

### Command Line 
used since 2011

A good grasp how to use the command line for a variety of tasks, with a familiarity with a few of the vast number of incredibly useful tools available. Obviously more recently using the command line for grunt and task runners to aid automated build tasks and testing.

### Other notable skills/technologies:
* Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android: used both professionally and personally.
* Apache: Familiarity with working on (configuring/maintaining) Apache.
* SVN, Git
* Regex used intermittently since: <time datetime="2011" class="since-date">2011</span>
* JSP used rarely since: <time datetime="2011" class="since-date">2011</span>
* XML, XSLT used rarely since: <time datetime="2009" class="since-date">2009</span>
* SQL: a solid grasp of writing queries with some exposure to performance tuning and optimizations for queries. Understanding of relational database design and n-tier normalization.
* PHP, C#, Java: varied or limited experience/exposure having worked on a number of different projects that may have used these programming languages.
* MongoDB: limited knowledge/exposure but took an online course in order to get some experience.
* Photoshop: reasonable usage, knowing how to take designs and images and do simplistic editing.

## Previous Employment
### Telegraph Media Group
September 2015 - December 2018

As a Senior Engineer at the Telegraph I played the leading role in cleaning up the implementation of their templates and renderers used. This has the long term aim of simplifying and improving: development, maintenance, testing and performance. This meant understanding the entire breadth of the offering of the Telegraph, its 45 different page types and their implementation details.

I was part of a small set of people who helped to drastically improve the performance of pages on the Telegraph, taking Speed Index from 12s (5mb/1mb 20ms latency) to 4s. That improvement was achieved incrementally on an old codebase, with the new implementation of templates, that was brought down to less than a second, see: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/ 

#### Projects worked on whilst at The Telegraph:
* Rebuilding lists (lists form more than 60% of the website)
* New implementation of front-end build process
* CSS and JS linting for TMG
* Adding user-commenting
* MyTelegraph (following Journalists and Topics)
* Performance improvement of website
* Integrating with Apple News
* Launching Travel vertical

#### Technologies used or exposed to:
* Javascript, HTML, CSS, AEM/CQ, SASS, BASH, Akamai, Node/NPM, React, Jest, Mocha, Chai, Java, Git, Maven, Bamboo, Jenkins, JSP, Apache, curl

### IG
December 2011 - June 2015
                    
#### Technologies used or exposed to:
* Javascript, HTML, CSS, LESS, Jasmine, jQuery, ExtJS, Mocha, Chai, Sinon, CasperJS, Grunt, Karma, CQ, Java, SVN, Maven, Bamboo, Jenkins, JSP, Apache, Node/NPM, curl

#### Projects worked on whilst at IG:
#### Building IG.com
Consolidating IG’s multiple websites (12 – one per country) down to just <a href="http://www.ig.com/">www.ig.com</a>. This involved moving from a custom internal CMS to Adobe’s CQ CMS (now AEM). It posed a number of design and SEO challenges that had to be solved as well.

#### Improving the deployment process:
The objective was to move from a 4 week release cycle down to 2 weeks, which involved introducing unit tests and functional testing as well as a script to run for the deploy process itself. I introduced and trained the team in writing and using unit and functional tests.
#### Making <a href="http://www.ig.com/">IG.com</a>
In order to comply with Google’s ‘mobile-friendly’ directives we established a number of best practices for the content teams to follow and tweaked components to make them work across as many devices as possible.
#### Stronger Encryption:
In order to address a potential https exploit on an Akamai Edge server we had to work with several teams to implement a version of the password reset functionality that added another layer of encryption to the password being submitted. This work was also designed to follow the principals of graceful degradation and progressive enhancement.

### First*Clarity

Brought in to extend the service offerings provided by Collective. I took the lead on a variety of technical endeavors that were already undertaken by Collective, such as: a Web-to-Print Management System and Photobook-Software (built by a 3rd party which Collective created and administered products).

As the only developer there I was responsible for the setup of my working environment and the estimation of all quotes on any tenders or bids involving development work. I was also responsible for all interaction with clients regarding the development of their site including doing things like needs analysis and requirements scoping.

### Netizen Digital
February 2007 - October 2008
