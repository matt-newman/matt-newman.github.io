    intro: "Brought in to help re-build replace a legacy PHP based system that was self-hosted. Built a new platform using AWS services on top of a provider platform, designed using micro-service architecture, with a NextJs UI application to deliver an internal tool allowing configuration management of a complex set of systems and product offerings.",

It connected to multiple underlying service-providers and services and had to have good integration testing and design."
