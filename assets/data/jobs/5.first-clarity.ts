    intro: `
        I started as a UI developer working on a custom CMS for European Directories, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I gained skills in SVN, command line, Java, Maven, Jenkins, and front-end testing. I also did wire-framing, documentation, and performance testing. Eventually, I became a team lead, co-leading a team of 20 front-end developers and conducting educational sessions on problem-solving principles
