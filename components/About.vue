        <p>There is a live version of this document, effectively my CV, hosted at
            <a class="link" href="https://matt-newman.github.io/">matt-newman.github.io</a>
        </p>

        <p>Lead / Senior Engineer with experience at scale as well as start-up and scale-up.</p>

        <p>I enjoy solving problems, working effectively with others to produce enjoyable experiences for both
        end-users and dev teams.</p>

        <p>In my own time, I enjoy team sports and play a lot of football, increasingly more golf. I also enjoy co-op
        gaming, chess, word-play games, snowboarding and myriad other things too.</p>

        <p>... also I'm a dog owner of a wonderful labrador. Dexter!</p>
