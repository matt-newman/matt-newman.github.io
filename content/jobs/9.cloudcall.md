Brought in to help re-build replace a legacy PHP based system that was self-hosted. Built a new platform using AWS services on top of a provider platform, designed using micro-service architecture, with a NextJs UI application to deliver an internal tool allowing configuration management of a complex set of systems and product offerings.

## Projects:
### Replatforming from legacy on-site to cloud-based 
Overall this took different guises at different stages, but largely leaned into building using AWS services and a distributed event-driven architecture, leveraging SNS & SQS. It connected to multiple underlying service-providers and services and had to have good integration testing and design.

### Micro-frontend builds
This was to facilitate component re-use between disparate systems with commonality, it used Typescript, React, GraphQL, connecting to a set of lambdas that formed a mirco-service backed architecture.

#### Tech:
Typescript, React, Javascript, GraphQL, NextJs, AWS (AppSync, SNS, SQS, Lambda, IAM, Cloudfront, Route53, S3, API Gateway), Jest, Cypress, Node/NPM, GitLab, Github, PHP, PgSQL
