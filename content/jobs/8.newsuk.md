Helped the core Sun and Times teams do performance optimizations.
Setup the pipeline build for the Commercial Engineering team, using CircleCI (with npm/bash commands) to bring it in line with the wider NewsUK platform usage.

#### Projects

##### Replace existing Admanager/Prebid integration
This forms the mechanism by which The Sun (and later all NewsUK sites), have their ads delivered/displayed, so is absolutely crucial as it forms a major part of their revenue strategy.

##### Deployment pipeline
As we worked on a new system, it made sense to replace the existing (difficult and multi-step) process with one that was easy, reliable and consistent.

##### Sun & Times Performance improvements
Due to personal interest as well as experience in this domain, I was able to help the core web teams review, plan and enact a number of improvements.
