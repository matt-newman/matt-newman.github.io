Led development for the Commercial Engineering team, we overhauled/replaced the existing Admanager integration, achieving a 3-fold increase in ad-revenue on [thesun.co.uk](https://www.thesun.co.uk/)

Whilst there I also helped the core Sun and Times teams do some performance optimization improvements.
I setup the pipeline build for the Commercial Engineering team, using CircleCI (with npm/bash commands) to bring it in line with the wider NewsUK platform usage.

## Projects:
### Replace existing Admanager/Prebid integration
This forms the mechanism by which The Sun (and later all NewsUK sites), have their ads delivered/displayed, so is absolutely cruical as it forms a major part of their revenue strategy.

### Deployment pipeline
As we worked on a new system, it made sense to replace the existing (difficult and multi-step) process with one that was easy, reliable and consistent.

### Sun & Times Performance improvements
Due to personal interest as well as experience in this domain, I was able to help the core web teams review, plan and enact a number of improvements.

#### Tech:
Typescript, React, Javascript, Prebid, Wordpress, CirceCI, Jest, Cypress, Node/NPM, AWS, Github
