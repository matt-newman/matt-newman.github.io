As a Senior Engineer at the Telegraph I played a leading role in cleaning up the implementation of their templates and renderers used. This has the long term aim of simplifying and improving: development, maintenance, testing and performance. This meant understanding the entire breadth of the offering of the Telegraph, its 45 different page types and their implementation details.

I was part of a small set of people who helped to drastically improve the performance of pages on the Telegraph, taking Speed Index from 12s (5mb/1mb 20ms latency) to 4s. That improvement was achieved incrementally on an old codebase, with the new implementation of templates, that was brought down to less than 2 seconds, see: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/) the overall performance measure was changed to leverage lighthouse reports.
