<div class="overview">
    <p>As a Senior Engineer at the Telegraph I played the leading role in cleaning up the implementation of their
        templates and renderers used. This has the long term aim of simplifying and improving: development, maintenance,
        testing and performance. This meant understanding the entire breadth of the offering of the Telegraph, its 45
        different page types and their implementation details.</p>
    <p>I was part of a small set of people who helped to drastically improve the performance of pages on the Telegraph,
        taking Speed Index from 12s (5mb/1mb 20ms latency) to 4s. That improvement was achieved incrementally on an old
        codebase, with the new implementation of templates, that was brought down to less than 2 seconds, see:
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/</a> the overall performance measure was changed to leverage lighthouse reports.
