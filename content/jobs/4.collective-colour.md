<div class="intro">

Brought in to extend the service offerings provided by Collective. I took the lead on a variety of technical endeavours that were already undertaken by Collective, such as: a Web-to-Print Management System and Photobook-Software (built by a 3rd party which Collective created and administered products).

As the only developer there I was responsible for the setup of my working environment and the estimation of all quotes on any tenders or bids involving development work. I was also responsible for all interaction with clients regarding the development of their site including doing things like needs analysis and requirements scoping.
