<!--more-->

Lead / Senior Engineer with experience at scale as well as start-up and scale-up.

I enjoy solving problems, working effectively with others to produce enjoyable experiences for both end-users and dev teams.

In my own time, I enjoy team sports and play a lot of football, increasingly more golf. I also enjoy co-op gaming, chess, word-play games, snowboarding and myriad other things too.

... also I'm a dog owner of a wonderful labrador. Dexter!
